# Idiom-Corpora-Construction-via-Large-Language-Models

🎯**Project goal:** The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of artificially generated idiom datasets in various languages by training state-of-the-art models on idiom detection tasks.

❓ **Why:**

- Idioms are challenging for most NLP tasks since their meaning cannot be obtained by compositionally interpreting their word constituents.
- Obtaining a high quality and comprehensive idiom dataset is costly and time consuming.
- There is uncertainty for researchers and practitioners in deciding whether to rely on LLMs for synthetic data generation or to proceed with the traditional data collection and curation pipeline when they need to construct a model for a new task.

🔬 **Research questions:**

- How does the performance of state-of-the-art models on idiom detection tasks compare when trained on artificially generated idiom datasets versus traditionally curated datasets?
- What is the quality of idiom datasets generated by large language models (LLMs) in terms of diversity, accuracy, and representativeness of real-world idiomatic usage?
- How does the cost (in terms of resources and time) of generating an idiom dataset using LLMs compare to traditional data collection and curation methods?
